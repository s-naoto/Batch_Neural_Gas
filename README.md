# Batch_Neural_Gas
## How to use
  `$ python BatchNeuralGas.py 'data-shape'`
  
  `'data-shape'` is chosen from `gaussian`, `rings`, `rectangle` and `2circles`.
  
  When it execute, a directory named `'data-shape'` is made and the state of weight vectors of each steps
  are save as images in the directory `'data_shape'`.
